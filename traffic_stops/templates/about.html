        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
            Open Data Policing is a project of the
            <a href="http://www.scsj.org">Southern Coalition for Social
            Justice</a>. The site’s North Carolina
            platform was launched in December 2015. The North Carolina
            development team consisted of attorney Ian Mance of the Southern
            Coalition and volunteer developers Colin Copeland, Andy Shapiro,
            and Dylan Young, all of Durham, NC.  The Maryland and Illinois
            platforms were launched in October 2016 and were developed by
            Southern Coalition and <a href="http://www.caktusgroup.com">Caktus
            Group</a>, with generous support from
            the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society
            Foundations</a>’ Democracy Fund.
