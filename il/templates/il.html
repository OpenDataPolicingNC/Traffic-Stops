    We are not doing a proper search page in this initial draft of Illinois.
    Thus we do not want actual tabs to take up this space, as the second tab
    does not have any useful content.

  <p>
      Open Data Policing aggregates, visualizes, and publishes public
      records related to all known traffic stops to have occurred in Illinois
      since January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2014. Data is available for most
      Illinois departments.
  </p>
  <p>
      Illinois law requires all such agencies to report their data
      on a monthly basis to the IL state government; however, some
      datasets are incomplete or remain unreported.  Where data sets are
      incomplete or missing from the website it is because they have not
      been reported to the state agency from which the site derives its
      records. Open Data Policing does not have access to, nor does it
      publish, the names of officers, drivers, or passengers involved in
      traffic stops.
