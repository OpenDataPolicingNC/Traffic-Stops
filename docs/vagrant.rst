Vagrant Testing
========================


Starting the VM
------------------------

You can test the provisioning/deployment using `Vagrant
<http://vagrantup.com/>`_. Using the included Vagrantfile you can start up the
VM. This requires Vagrant 1.3+ and the ``precise32`` box. The box will be
installed if you don't have it already.::

    vagrant up

The general provision workflow is the same as in the previous
:doc:`provisioning guide </provisioning>` so here are notes of the Vagrant
specifics.


Provisioning the VM
------------------------

The Vagrantfile is configured to install the Salt Master and Minion inside the
VM once you've run ``vagrant up``. To finalize the provisioning you simply need
to run::

    fab vagrant salt:saltutil.sync_all
    fab vagrant highstate

The Vagrant box will use the current working copy of the project and the
local.py settings. If you want to use this for development/testing it is
helpful to change your local settings to extend from staging instead of dev::

    # Example local.py
    from traffic_stops.settings.staging import *

    # Override settings here
    DATABASES['default']['NAME'] = 'traffic_stops_local'
    DATABASES['default']['USER'] = 'traffic_stops_local'
    
    DEBUG = True

This won't have the same nice features of the development server such as auto-
reloading but it will run with a stack which is much closer to the production
environment.


Testing on the VM
------------------------

With the VM fully provisioned and deployed, you can access the VM at the IP address specified in the
``Vagrantfile``, which is 33.33.33.10 by default. Since the Nginx configuration will only listen for the domain name in
``conf/pillar/staging/env.sls``, you will need to modify your ``/etc/hosts`` configuration to view it
at one of those IP addresses. I recommend 33.33.33.10, otherwise the ports in the localhost URL cause
the CSRF middleware to complain ``REASON_BAD_REFERER`` when testing over SSL. You will need to add::

    33.33.33.10 <domain>

where ``<domain>`` matches the domain in ``conf/pillar/staging/env.sls``. For example, let's use
staging.example.com::

    33.33.33.10 staging.example.com

In your browser you can now view https://staging.example.com and see the VM running the full web stack.

Note that this ``/etc/hosts`` entry will prevent you from accessing the true staging.example.com.
When your testing is complete, you should remove or comment out this entry.
